### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
The code attempts to read a text file named `sample.txt`.  
- If the file exists, it prints each line with its corresponding line number.
- If the file does not exist, it prints an appropriate error message.

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
The code allows the user to interact with a file named `output.txt`.
- It first takes user input and writes it to the file, overwriting any existing content.
- It then takes additional input and appends it to the same file.
- Finally, it reads and displays the complete content of the file.
