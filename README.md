##Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- Takes an integer input from the user
- Uses `if-else` to check if the number is even or odd
- Displays the result

##Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50
- Calculates the total sum
- Displays the sum

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
The code defines a function factorial(n) that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- It takes an integer input from the user.
- Handles negative input by returning 'None'.
- If non negative integers input, prints the factorial of that number.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This task performs three mathematical operations using Pythonâ€™s built-in 'math' module:
- Square Root: Calculates the square root using 'math.sqrt()'
- Natural Logarithm: Computes natural log (base e) using 'math.log()'
-Sine Function: Computes sine in radians using 'math.sin()'
- It ensures the input is valid for log and square root (i.e., the number must be positive).
- 'math.sin() is calculated for all values.
